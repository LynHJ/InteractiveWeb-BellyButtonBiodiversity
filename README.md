I am also very interesting on exlporing Universe. Mars perhape is our next destination to continute next human generations.  
 
This project has two parts. First part is scraping news from 'https://redplanetscience.com ' and storing data in MongoDB and as a json file. Second part is also using scraping skill to retrieve weather data from another website. Then based on the dataset, I will perform some simple data analsis.
