## Background

The task is using my new skill <b>JaveScript</b> to display a dashboard about an experiment of Belly Button Biodiversity.The dataset I am going to use is a json file within a provided url. 
 
This dashboard has four parts. Each part utilises different types of chart to highlight the structure of datasets.First part is a dropdown-menu which gives us a view of how many participants participate in that experiment. Second part is the participants' details. Let's move on to the third part,'Gauge Plot'. It indicates the frequency of a participant washing their body which can let us easily compare each other when we do the selections. And the last part is a bubble chart.I use each bacterias' amount as markers' size. It visualises the quantity variance among them.

##### Summary: 

This dashboard does visualise the details of each participant from individual details. The results of bacteria vary between each persons. Unfortunately, I could not observe the relation between individual washing frequency, bacteria types, and amount of bacteria. Besides that, it is good practice for me to have the ability to produce a dashboard without using PowerBI or Tableau.
